Open Flight Simulation (oFS)

oFS is a companion to OpenFlightAnalysis for data analysis and RAPTRS for flight software.

oFS is intended as a tool to generate and simulate flight vehicles. Currently, the tools use OpenVSP and/or AVL as sources for Aerodynamic data. The aerodynamic data is parsed and augmented with sub-system specification (propulsion, actuation, etc.) into an intermediate format known as oFdm (Open Flight Dynamics Model). The oFdm can be used to generate a complete simulation definition for JSBSim (or Flightgear).
